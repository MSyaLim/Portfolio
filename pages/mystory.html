    <h1 >Greetings! My name is Mohd Syakir Lim and this is my 'My Story' page.</h1>
    <h3>So, what do I do actually? Well I do a lot of things!</h3>
    <h3>Alright, in first sight you might say "Oh, you just play games all day and never do anything useful"</h3>
    <h3>Well... That's true, but I do more than just play games. I am also a Game Developer! I started during the pandemic of 2019.</h3>
    <h3>Lockdown kinda hurts so I started experimenting, started to see things in a broader sense.</h3>
    <h3>Hey! How do people make these games? Seems Inticing. I said, and it was.</h3>
    <h3>I started scouring the internet and youtube to find ways to create a game and I stumbled upon Godot 3.0</h3>
    <h3>It was SOOOO MUCH FUN, "Look at the little cube running about!" "Look at the fascinating animations!" I got carried away and learnt more in 1 week.</h3>
    <div class="colourimportant"><h4>even almost accidentally skipped online class but don't tell anyone that :D</h4></div>
    <h3>And soon I learned 2D game development and started to join game jams... Oh boy that was so intense.</h3>
    <h3>And after learning Game Development and doing it for 3 years I found another hobby. Electronics!</h3>
    <h3>It gave me more serotonin than Game Development!</h3>
    <div class="colourimportant"><h4>AND VERY COSTLY!</h4></div>
    <h3>As usually I started with the basics of Arduino UNO and then learning how to program it and made an LED blink. You know the simple stuff.</h3>
    <h3>Then I stumbled upon ESP32 chips... And I started to learn to make my own PCB</h3>
    <h4>And my only PCB that I will order online :p</h4>
    <h3>So I surf the Internet and found a way to make my own. Good ol' ferric chloride, very dangerous though so I also splurge on some lab safety gear.</h3>
    <h3>And long to behold, I got myself a fresh PCB made with chemicals and copper clads.</h3>
    <h3>But I wanted more. Its very inacurate since you have to use a marker and the market's lines are just absurdly large.</h3>
    <div class="colourimportant"><h4>even accidentally sparked me once!</h4></div>
    <h3>So I used materials I learned from high school. ELECTROLYSIS!</h3>
    <h3>Though I didn't manage to do it, it's theorarically possible. I did the math! Just takes... A LOT of power and time.</h3>
    <h3>Some where in between I also learned how to build a PC and tinkered a bit into laptop hacking for custom OS for Chromebooks.</h3>
    <h3>Honestly it was fairly simple. It's the same problem with electronics just ten folds. The cost of the components.</h3>
    <h3>...</h3>
